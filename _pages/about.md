Shijun Liang earned his B.S. in Biochemistry from the University of California, Davis in 2017 and his Ph.D. in Biomedical Engineering from Michigan State University in 2025. His research leverages machine learning and optimization techniques to tackle inverse problems in imaging. In particular, he focuses on machine learningâ€“based image reconstruction and on enhancing the robustness of learning-based reconstruction algorithms. In April 2025, he will begin a joint postdoctoral appointment at the University of Michigan and Michigan State University.
